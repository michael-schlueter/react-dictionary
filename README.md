# Dictionary Application
> This is a Dictionary App using ReactJS and Material UI. The app allows you to translate words into 12 different languages using the Dictionary API.



## General Information
- I undertook this project in order to familiarize myself with the use of Material UI to style components
- In particular, I wanted to get to know how to implement a Light Mode / Dark Mode in a React app using Material UI
- I also wanted to grasp the concept of progressive web app and understand what is necessary to turn an app into a PWA



## Technologies Used
- React 17.0.2
- MaterialUI 4.12.3
- Axios 0.21.1



## Features
- Translating words into 12 different languages
- Switch between a Light Mode and a Dark Mode

## Demo
Live demo [_here_](https://practical-morse-116670.netlify.app/).



## Setup
The dependencies which are necessary to run this app can be found in the package.json file.

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal and install the necessary NPM dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Run the app typing
```
npm start
```
in the terminal



## Learnings
- using MaterialUI to style components (Theme, ThemeSwitcher, ThemeProvider)
- implementing Light / Dark Mode with the help of the MaterialUI
- transformation to a Progressive Web App
- making requests using Axios instead of fetch API



## Project Status
The project is finished. I didn't find it necessary to add any further features to it.


## Acknowledgements
- This project was based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToXna81iij0).
- I watched the video and tried to implement its concepts myself. Therefore there may only be slight differences in code.
